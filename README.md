**Recursive Feasibility Guided Optimal Parameter Adaptation of Differential Convex Optimization Policies for Safety-Critical Systems**

Authors: Hardik Parwana, Dimitra Panagou, University of Michigan

## Description
We pose the question: What is the best we can do *given a parametric controller*? How to adapt their parameters in face of different external conditions? And what if the controller is an optimization problem itself? Can be maintain *feasibility over a horizon* if we change the parameter?
